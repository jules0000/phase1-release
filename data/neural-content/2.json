            "content": "Text-generating AI is like having a super-smart writing assistant that can create human-like text on almost any topic. These AI systems are trained on massive amounts of text from books, websites, and articles, learning patterns of how language works. Unlike traditional software that follows strict rules, generative AI creates original content by predicting what words should come next based on context. It's not copying text but generating new combinations that make sense based on its training."

            "content": "Text AI models work by analyzing patterns in the enormous amounts of text they're trained on. Think of it like a super-powered autocomplete that understands context. The AI breaks down text into smaller pieces called tokens (words or parts of words) and learns statistical relationships between them. When you give it a prompt, it predicts the most likely next words based on these patterns. More advanced models can maintain context over longer passages, making their responses more coherent and relevant."

There are also open-source models like Llama from Meta that developers can customize. Each has slightly different strengths in creativity, accuracy, or specific capabilities."
