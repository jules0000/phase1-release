            "content": "A prompt is simply how you talk to an AI—it's your question, instruction, or request. Think of it like giving directions to a very smart but very literal person. If you say 'write something about dogs,' you might get a scientific article, a poem, or a story. But if you say 'write a funny short story about a dog who becomes a chef,' the AI understands exactly what you want. Good prompts are the key to getting helpful responses from AI tools."

A vague prompt gets a vague response, while a clear, specific prompt gets exactly what you need. Learning to write good prompts saves you time, reduces frustration, and helps you use AI tools more effectively for school, work, and creative projects. It's like learning to ask the right questions to get the best help."

A well-written prompt can turn a confusing, generic response into a focused, useful answer. The AI has incredible knowledge, but it needs your guidance to deliver that knowledge in the way that's most helpful to you."
