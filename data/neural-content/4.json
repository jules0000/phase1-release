When your photos automatically organize into albums like 'Beach Vacation' or 'Best Friends,' that's AI recognizing faces and scenes. Your keyboard's autocorrect and word suggestions use AI to predict what you might type next. Even your phone's battery optimization uses AI to learn your usage patterns and save power. These smart features learn from your habits to personalize your experience without you needing to do anything special."

It looks at patterns like who sent it, the words used, and how other people have treated similar emails. The more you use your email (marking things as spam or not), the better it gets at protecting you. This is why your inbox stays relatively clean despite thousands of spam emails being sent to you every day."

This helps travelers read signs, students understand foreign texts, and families communicate across language barriers. The technology keeps improving as it learns from millions of translated documents and corrections from users around the world."
