# Phase 2 Release - Additional Features

Hi there,

This document explains what you'll receive in Phase 2 after the remaining 50% payment ($1,175).

## What's Included in Phase 2

## What This Means

When you receive Phase 2, you'll have the complete, full-featured platform with everything I've built. The MVP features from Phase 1 will continue to work, and you'll get all the additional functionality on top of that.

## Timeline

Phase 2 will be delivered after:
1. You review and accept Phase 1 delivery
2. Payment of the remaining 50% ($1,175) is received
3. I package and deliver the Phase 2 files

## Questions?
